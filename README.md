# images_to_excel

AHK scripts used to paste all the images (resized) from given folder to the new excel file. Used in https://github.com/mban1993/image_scraping-Opals

XL.ahk library included and must be in same directory as other ahk scripts.

You have a folder named 'opals', where are all opal images stored (and only images you want to paste into excel file!).

Use one of AHK scripts - one pastes small-sized images, second one pastes larger images. Select folder 'opals'. After that, new excel file should be opened
with list of opals and their names.
